This file is created as part of the GitHub training session.
In this task, I performed the following steps:

1. Created a new branch called 'featuredoc' from the main branch.
2. Added this README.txt file in the forked folder.
3. Staged and committed the changes.
4. Pushed the 'featuredoc' branch to my GitHub fork.
5. Prepared to raise a Pull Request (PR) for review.
